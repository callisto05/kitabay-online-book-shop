The contents of the file `/kitabay/kitabay/frontend/public/favicon.ico` should be a binary file representing the favicon for the frontend application. Since it's a binary file, I cannot generate its contents programmatically. You can use any favicon generator tool to create the favicon.ico file and place it in the specified location.
